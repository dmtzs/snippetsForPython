# Description
This are old python snippets from the python extension of vscode. I put here these snippets in order to have a quick search for add these snippets to a new vscode download in one of my computers.
<br>
These snippets are not a personal creation, are just to preserve this but also have some modifications in the same snippets in which I think are better.
<br>

## Modifications
Coming soon a table showing the personal modifications.
